# Day 1 — Variables, Names, print(), Expressions

## Scope 
- Variables (names → values)
- Assignment (`=`)
- Reassignment
- Expressions
- Statements
- `print()` behavior
- Execution order

---

## Instructions (READ CAREFULLY)

- Write code in `.py` files.
- One file per question
- Use comments to explain **why**.
- Deliberate mistakes are required in some questions
- Run every file and observe output or errors

---

## Q1 — Variable Creation & Printing (Easy)

Create **three variables**:
- one integer
- one float
- one string

Print each value with a clear label.

**Rules**
- Use separate `print()` calls
- Do not combine values yet

---

## Q2 — Reassignment vs Initial Assignment (Easy → Medium)

1. Assign a number to a variable
2. Print it
3. Reassign a different number to the same variable
4. Print it again

### Extension

1. Assign a value to variable `a`
2. Assign `b = a`
3. Reassign `a` to a new value
4. Print both `a` and `b`

Add a comment answering:
- What changed
- What did NOT change
- Does `b` change?
- Why exactly?

---

## Q3 — Expressions Inside print() (Medium)

Write **only expressions** inside `print()`:

- One arithmetic expression
- One comparison expression
- One logical expression

After each `print()`, add a comment stating:
- The value printed
- The type of the value

---

## Q4 — Statement vs Expression (Medium → Hard)

Write the following **in separate lines**:

1. A line that is clearly an **expression**
2. A line that is clearly a **statement**
3. A line that looks like an expression but is actually a **statement**

Add comments justifying each classification.

---

## Q5 — Illegal Code: Assignment Rules (Hard)

Write **three separate **, each with ONE illegal line:

1. Assignment inside `print()`
2. Assignment to a literal
3. Using a keyword as a variable name

For each:
- Run the file
- Copy the exact error message into a comment
- Explain in ONE sentence why Python rejects it

---

## Q6 — print() Return Value Test (Hard)

1. Call `print()` with any value
2. Store the result of `print()` in a variable
3. Print that variable

Add comments answering:
- What does `print()` return?
- Why is that important?
