# Data Engineering Roadmap (Foundations → Industry Ready)

This repository documents my structured journey into **Data Engineering**, built deliberately from first principles instead of shortcuts.

The goal is not to rush tools, but to develop **execution clarity, debugging confidence, and system-level understanding** that actually holds up in real work and interviews.

This repo evolves over time. Each folder represents a **learning milestone**, not a finished product.

---

## Why this repository exists

Many learning paths jump straight into libraries and frameworks.  
This roadmap takes a different approach:

- start from how programs actually execute
- understand errors instead of memorizing fixes
- build habits that scale to production systems
- document learning honestly, not artificially

Everything here is written, broken, fixed, and committed intentionally.

## Structure (high level)

├── python_ass/
│ ├── variables_print/
│ ├── README.md
│ ├── var_print.py
│ ├── var_assigning.py
│ ├── print_operations.py
│ ├── print_error.py



Each subfolder has its own README explaining:
- what was learned
- why it matters
- common mistakes explored deliberately

---

## Topics covered so far

### Python foundations
- how Python executes a program
- syntax vs runtime vs type errors
- `print()` behavior and return value (`None`)
- variables as names pointing to objects
- expressions vs statements
- assignment rules and ambiguity prevention
- keywords and why they are reserved
- core data types and their hierarchy
- `None` and absence of value
- arithmetic and comparison operators
- legal vs illegal vs confusing code patterns
- mutability vs immutability (lists vs integers)

These are treated as **concepts**, not just syntax.

---

## Learning philosophy

- slow where depth matters
- fast only when foundations are solid
- predict → run → observe → explain
- commit learning states, not perfection
- clarity over cleverness

Mistakes are not hidden.  
They are explored, explained, and documented.

## References used

- *Python Crash Course (3rd Edition)* – Eric Matthes  
- GeeksforGeeks (concept reinforcement & edge cases)  
- W3Schools (syntax reference only)

No single source is treated as authority in isolation.

---

## Roadmap (planned)

- Python foundations (current)
- control flow and loops
- data structures in depth
- SQL fundamentals
- Python + SQL together (ETL thinking)
- pipeline design basics
- interview preparation
- industry-ready refinement

---

## Status

🚧 Work in progress  
This repository will continue to evolve as concepts deepen and projects are added.

this repo shows **how I think**, not just what I’ve touched.
